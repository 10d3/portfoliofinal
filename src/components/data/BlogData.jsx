        The <strong>useParams</strong> hook serves as a functional component
        hook, granting you direct access to the dynamic parameters embedded
        within the current URL path. It functions by meticulously extracting the
        values defined within the route configuration and returning them as a
        structured object. This object acts as a repository for key-value pairs,
        where the keys represent the parameter names specified in your routes,

        from the URL.

        To harness the power of the useParams hook, ensure you have the

          <strong>Step 1: Create a context</strong>
          <pre>
            <Code>{`
const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  theme: 'light',
  toggleTheme: () => {},
});`}</Code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: Wrap components</strong>
          <pre>
            <Code w="100%">{`function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'üåë' : '‚òÄÔ∏è');
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider
      value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}
    >
      {/* Your app components here */}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}`}</Code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: Access the data</strong>
          <pre>
            <Code>
              {`function Button() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } =
    useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button
      style={{ backgroundColor: theme }}
    >
      {theme} Mode | <button
        onClick={toggleTheme}
      >
        Toggle
      </button>
    </button>
  );
}`}
            </Code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </>
    ),
    des3: "Now, any component within the App component can access the theme and toggle function without needing to pass them down explicitly. No more prop drilling!",
    conclusion: (

        <br />
        <strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br /> useContext is a powerful tool for
        managing shared data in your React app. It helps you avoid prop drilling
        and creates a more maintainable and reusable component structure. So,
        next time you find yourself in a data-sharing pickle, remember:
        useContext is your friend!
