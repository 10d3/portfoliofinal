  <>
    Hello! My name is Herley, and at 23 years old, I am passionate about
    computer science and technology, with an unwavering commitment to excellence
    in front-end development. From a young age, my fascination with computers
    led me to explore and unravel the mysteries of the digital world. Hailing
    from a challenging environment in Haiti, where access to technological
    resources is limited, I grew up surrounded by the determination to overcome
    obstacles and the creativity to find innovative solutions.<br/> My journey in the
    realm of computer science has been shaped by adversity and perseverance. In
    a country where resources are scarce, I have dedicated myself to cultivating
    my skills through self-directed learning and the relentless pursuit of
    knowledge online. Thanks to the internet, I have been able to acquire skills
    in software development, website design, and cybersecurity, overcoming
    geographical and socioeconomic barriers that could have hindered my
    progress.<br/> My experience as a freelancer has provided me with the opportunity
    to collaborate with professionals from diverse parts of the world, enriching
    my perspective and skills. Through challenging projects, I have demonstrated
    my ability to translate creative concepts into innovative and functional
    digital solutions.<br/> In this portfolio, you will find a carefully curated
    selection of my standout projects, ranging from sleek websites to
    interactive applications and robust security solutions. Each project is the
    result of my dedication to technical excellence and my commitment to
    customer satisfaction.<br/> As a professional committed to continuous growth, I
    am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
    Currently, I am immersed in studying the latest trends in front-end
    technology and pursuing certifications in cybersecurity to strengthen my
    skill set.<br/> I am available for exciting and challenging collaborations that
    allow me to apply my experience and creativity to drive the success of
    innovative projects. Feel free to contact me to explore how we can work
    together to bring your digital ideas to life.
